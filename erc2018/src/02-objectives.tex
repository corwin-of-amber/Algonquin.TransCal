\subsection{Objectives}

My goal is to \textbf{develop a new foundation that unifies automated reasoning} as embodied in past and future results in the fields of SMT and ATP.
To achieve this, I point out three central pillars that carry the weight of automated reasoning,
in particular when reasoning about computer programs is concerned.
The three pillars are: reasoning about equality, proof by induction, and modular theorem proving.
Each of them opens up several avenues of research, as reflected in \autoref{b2:methodology}.
