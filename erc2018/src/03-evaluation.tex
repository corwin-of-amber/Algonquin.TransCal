\subsection{Evaluation of Project Success}

A true testament to the success of the project would be to see theories and tools produced by the project team get into wider circulation and deployed in certified software projects in the model of DeepSpec and others.
We will measure the amount of proof goals that we have been able to automated, internally within the project team as part of Objective 4 and externally by other researchers in formal methods who will have adopted our tools.
For this purpose, it is important that our tools would fit within the larger ecosystem of software verifiers and (most importantly) proof assistants,
so that even in early stages when our tools cannot meet the scalability requirements needed to lift an entire proof,
\emph{some parts} of the proofs can be automated.
When this occurs, we will estimate and mark the number of man-months saved (in hindsight) by the automation.
This will have an enormous impact as it attests to our tools becoming a power multiplier for all future endeavors in proof engineering.
I will also build on vast experienced collected in ``QED at large''~\cite{Book2019:Ringer} --- a comprehensive survey of mechanical proving techinques and practices.
