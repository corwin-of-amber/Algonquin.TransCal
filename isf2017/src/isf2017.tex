It is definitely the Age of Software.
After having infiltrated our homes, our cars, our pockets and wrists,
after startup engineers have seemingly launched every app imaginable,
the demand for software refuses to decline.
Its success in the private space catalyzes its application to the public
space as well: clinics and offices shift toward Web-based appointment
scheduling and information delivery, and even government agencies are
inclined to offer their services online.
The thirst for information causes more data stores to open up to the
public, and the flow of data requires organization, searching and sorting
to make sense of it.
Soon enough our wallets will be filled with electronic currency and
manage trade contracts for us.
In this new economy it will become hard to imagine how we could ever
shop for groceries without software.
