\section{Detailed Description of the Research Plan}

\subsection{Rewrite-based Deductive Synthesis}

\subsection{Developing a Library of Rules and Tactics}

\subsection{Theory of Saturating Rewrite Systems}

\subsection{When to Stop?}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Metrics for safety
  \item Dynamic rippling
  \item Resource-aware type systems
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Termination Proofs}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Is it enough to prove termination of the high-level program?
