# Transcal

## About
Hi,

If you are reading this, you are in luck (that this file exists).

We are going to write a general description of how the system works. 
First we will describe the transcal language and than how the rewrite system works.
The system was rewritten to include the minimum possible assumptions but there are
still some so it is recommended to read to the end.

## The Language
We are working on passing AST's and types from COQ. 
Need to update this if the feature works.
