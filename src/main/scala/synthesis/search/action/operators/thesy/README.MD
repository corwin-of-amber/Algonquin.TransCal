TheSy - Theory Synthesis

Please read the papar before starting here.
TheSy is built out of 4 main stages, 
Term generation, conjecture inference, conjecture filtering 
and an inductive prover.
These are implemented as two classes, 
conjecture generator creats terms and inferences conjectures.
The prover implements both the prover and the filtering.

SOE - symbolic observation equivalence is used both
